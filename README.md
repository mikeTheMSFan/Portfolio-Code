I'm sharing this code to give people insight into my thought process when tackling a project. Feel free to use and alter it as you see fit.

### Prerequisites

To run a local copy of the code, please make sure you have the following software installed:

- Microsoft .NET 7 SDK
- Entity Framework Core v6.2.0
- Oracle MySQL v8.0.32

## Usage

Please feel free to use this code in your own project. If there's a better solution for anything in this repo, please get in touch as I am eager to learn.
